# Lab: Aries Agent Test Harness


## Overview

In this lab, we'll take a look at the Aries Agent Test Harness that can be used for testing Aries agent interoperability.


## How to Run

We’ll run this lab from the GitHub repository for the Aries Agent Test Harness, relying on it for “how to run” guidance.


## Instructions

All the instructions you need to try out (and even contribute to) the Aries Agent Test Harness are in the repo. Click [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness) and follow the instructions in the repo's ReadMe to do a quick run of the tests in the harness. You can use Play with Docker and just run the tests in a browser, or run the tests
on your own system. Check out the rest of the documentation in the repo to learn (lots) more about the test harness, the tests, how to add tests and how to add support for testing
your own component.

## Takeaways

The Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) is a way to create and run interoperability tests across multiple agents and agent frameworks. The tests in the test harness are aligned to the [Aries
RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs), and test agents and agent frameworks are combined in special code (called a "backchannel") to enable participation in interoperability tests.

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
