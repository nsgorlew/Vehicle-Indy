# Lab: Issuing, Holding, Proving and Verifying


## Overview

In this lab, we'll use a couple of simple services that issue and verify credentials, and use a mobile agent to hold and prove credentials.


## How to Run

There are no components for you to deploy on your own system for this lab as we are using services that have been deployed for everyone to use.


## Instructions

This tutorial is part of the BC Government’s open source [vc-authn-oidc](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/README.md) repository that provides an easy way to use verifiable credentials as an Open ID Connect (OIDC) identity provider (IdP). Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about OIDC or IdPs as that isn’t the focus of the lab. It’s about a service issuing a verifiable credential, you holding that credential in a wallet-based mobile agent, and then using that mobile agent to prove the credentials to a verifier.

The instructions for the lab can be found [here](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/DemoInstructions.md), including how you can get an a mobile agent. There are some extra links in the instructions that you may or may not want to follow, depending on your interest in OIDC. They are not part of the lab.


## Takeaways

This is a demonstration of some of the current user experiences with verified credentials. As you go through the demonstration, think about how the process works: 



*   What are the interactions to get a verifiable credential and to present a proof?  
*   How are those interactions handled on the website and in the mobile agent?  
*   What do you think of the user interface? How would a non-technical person do with that interface?  
*   What would you do differently?

As an Aries developer, these are the things that you can affect!

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
