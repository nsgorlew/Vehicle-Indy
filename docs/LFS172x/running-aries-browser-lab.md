# Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa Demonstrations

Welcome to the demonstration section of the Linux Foundation's edX course LF172x, Introduction to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions: Indy, Aries and Ursa. In this section we have two demonstrations of Indy, Aries and Ursa technology.

## Mobile Agent Demonstration

In the first (called "ConfBook"), we use an Aries smartphone wallet to interact with an Aries-based website (with Indy and Ursa embedded, of course) that issues you a verifiable credential, and a second site, also Aries-based, that requests a proof of the credential you have, asks you a question or two, and then issues you a second credential.

To see a screencast of an early version of the demo, click [here](https://youtu.be/bZrWAsD42-I). In the screencast, the demo is called "IIWBook" (now called "ConfBook"), and we used the Streetcred wallet, the predecessor of what is now the Trinsic wallet from [trinsic.id](trinsic.id).

Want to install an Aries wallet and run the demo yourself?  Click [here](https://vonx.io/how_to/confbook) for instructions on running through the ConfBook process.

## Web Agent Demonstration

In the second demonstration, we build and run a web-based demo of interacting agents that goes through the story of Alice getting proof of her degree from Faber College in the form of a verifiable credential, and then using the verifiable credential in a proof that is part of a job application at ACME Corp. This is getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but Alice gets the job!
