# Screencast: Browsing An Indy Ledger

In this presentation, we'll use a Hyperledger Indy ledger browser called [indyscan.io](https://indyscan.io) to take a look at some real DIDs, schema and other objects on Sovrin Foundation's MainNet ledger. MainNet is a global, production instance of an Indy ledger.

[indyscan.io](https://indyscan.io) is an open source project ([github repo](https://github.com/Patrik-Stas/indyscan)) that can be used to monitor the activity and search the transactions of any Hyperledger Indy network.

VON Network from the Government of British Columbia is a second Indy ledger browser, and also provides a [Sovrin MainNet ledger browser site](https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/). The open source [VON-Network github repo](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network) includes code to quickly spin up your own 4-node instance of a Hyperledger Indy ledger project running on Docker.
